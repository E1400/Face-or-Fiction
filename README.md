# Utilizing CNNs to detect and differentiate AI-Generated Faced from Real Human Faces

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to differentiate between AI-generated and real human faces. Using a dataset of real images (FFHQ dataset) and AI-generated images (thispersondoesnotexist.com), we preprocess, train, and evaluate a deep learning model to classify these faces accurately. Our goal is to delve into the detection of synthetic media and contribute to improving the reliability of AI-generated content verification to tackle real world problems (i.e. DeepFake Detection).
