# Utilizing CNNs to detect and differentiate AI-Generated Faced from Real Human Faces

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to differentiate between AI-generated and real human faces. Using a dataset of real images (FFHQ dataset) and AI-generated images (thispersondoesnotexist.com), we preprocess, train, and evaluate a deep learning model to classify these faces accurately. Our goal is to delve into the detection of synthetic media and contribute to improving the reliability of AI-generated content verification to tackle real world problems (i.e. DeepFake Detection).

### Datasets:
1) Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ) dataset of 70,000 real human faces reduced to 10,000 randomly selected faces for training/validation.
2) thispersondoesnotexist.com dataset of 10,000 AI-Generated human faces.

### CNN Model:
1) Xception
2) InceptionV3
